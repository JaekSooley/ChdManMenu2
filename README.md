# ChdManMenu2

A console application to simplify the use of chdman.exe.

This is a re-write of [chdman-menu](https://github.com/JaekSooley/chdman-menu) in C#

## Features:
- Pre-defined parameters for creating and extracting CHD files (ISO, CUE/BIN, GDI).
- Option to delete each file as it's compressed/extracted.
- Deletes CUE files _and associated BIN files_.
- Works with the latest version of chdman

## Instructions:
- Run the application.
- If chdman.exe is not present in the same directory as ChdManMenu2.exe, you will be asked to input a valid path to chdman.exe.
- Drag and drop a folder containing the files you wish to compress/extract into the window when prompted and press ENTER.
